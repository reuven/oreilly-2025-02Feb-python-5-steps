    "\n",
    "1. If you have several lines of code that are almost the same, then you can replace them with a loop.\n",
    "2. If you have code that repeats itself in several places in your program, then you can replace them with a function.\n",
    "3. If you have code that repeats itself in several different programs, then you can use a *library*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every programming language supports libraries. This way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have code that you'll use in several programs, you can write it once, and use it many times. (You can also debug it once, and have those fixes/improvements automatically get to be used in all programs at once.)\n",
    "- You can write a library that other people will use, so that they don't have to reinvent the wheel.\n",
    "- The reverse is true: You can use a library that other people have written, so that you don't have to reinvent the wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we call our libraries *modules*. Modules provide us with all of these advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Sometimes, we call it a package. We'll talk about that later. Spoiler: A package is a directory/folder containing multiple module files.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these advantages, Python modules also act as *namespaces*. The idea is that each module can define variables and functions with the same names, and they won't conflict with one another. A namespace is kind of like a last name for variables/functions. It means that we aren't going to have a \"namespace collision.\"\n",
    "\n",
